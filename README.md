# Docker Learning

This repository contains my notes and exercises as I learn Docker.  

Docker is a platform for building, running, and managing applications inside **containers** â€“ lightweight, portable units that ensure applications run the same in every environment.  

### Key Topics Covered
- What containers are and why theyâ€™re important  
- Docker images and Dockerfiles  
- Containerising a web application  
- Docker networking and Docker Compose  
- Docker registries (Docker Hub, AWS ECR)  
- Useful Docker commands  
- Multistage builds and orchestration tools
